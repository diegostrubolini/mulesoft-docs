Testing ensures that a piece of code works correctly. Testing a module is more than simply creating test cases for the business logic. A lot of testing of the interaction
between the Module and Mule is required to ensure compatibility with the Mule ecosystem.

The Module Testing Framework (Beta) leverages *MUnit* to provide this Mule ecosystem.
If you are not familiarized with the MUnit Framework, documentation about it can be found in the following section:

NOTE: Unit tests should also be present in a Module with the purpose of testing internal logic. This tests will run during the *test* phase of your module's lifecycle.
MUnit tests goal is to test the interaction of your module with the Mule environment, this tests will run during the *integration-test* phase of your module's lifecycle.

Here are a series of articles that explain in detail how to test your module. It provides a step-by-step introduction on how to test a module. It explains the basis of the Module Testing Framework (Beta)
and how to execute a simple operation from a Module.
